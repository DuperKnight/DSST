# DSST - Duper's Stoneworks Staff Tools
My plan is to one day merge all the other mods into a single one. This one.

## Commands

The following commands are available:

### 1. Rollback X-ray

This command is designed to help rollback X-ray related actions for a player. It executes a sequence of CoreProtect rollback commands.

**Syntax:**
`/rollbackxray <player>`

**Arguments:**
*   `<player>`: The in-game name of the player to investigate.

**Functionality:**
When executed, this command will:
1.  Rollback container transactions for the player within the last 7 days.
2.  Rollback deepslate ores and tuff block breaks for the player within the last 30 days.
3.  Rollback stone and ore blocks breaks (excluding deepslate variants) for the player within the last 30 days.
4.  Rollback ore blocks placements for the player within the last 30 days.
5.  Rollback deepslate ore blocks placements for the player within the last 30 days.

The mod will notify you when the rollback sequence for the player is complete or if an error occurs. Only one rollback operation can be active at a time, Sorry!

### 2. Prefix Create

This command facilitates the creation and configuration of player prefixes. It automates the process of creating a prefix, setting its limit, assigning a manager, and displaying its information when it finishes creating it.

**Syntax:**
`/prefixc <type> <ign> <prefixID> <prefix>`

**Arguments:**
*   `<type>`: The type of prefix, which determines its usage limit.
    *   `Normal`: Sets a limit of 10.
    *   `Mass`: Sets a limit of 30.
    *   `Unlimited`: Sets a very very high limit (effectively unlimited, 2,147,483,647 for my nerd friends).
    *   `<Custom Value>`: A specific number to set as the limit.
*   `<ign>`: The in-game name of the player who will be set as the manager of this prefix.
*   `<prefixID>`: A unique identifier for the new prefix.
*   `<prefix>`: The actual prefix string.

**Functionality:**
This command executes the following server commands in sequence:
1.  `prefix x create <prefixID> <prefix>`
2.  `prefix x setlimit <prefixID> <limitValue>` (limitValue is determined by `<type>`)
3.  `prefix x setmanager <prefixID> <ign>`
4.  `prefix x info <prefixID>`

The mod will notify you upon completion or if any error occurs during the process. Only one prefix creation operation can be active at a time, sorry again!

### 3. Purge Mode

This command is only supposed to be ran by Sr War staff, so don't run it!, it allows toggling a "purge mode" on the server by changing the `keepInventory` gamerule, before it was more useful when there was the npc bossbar, now its just a easier way to write the gamerule.

**Syntax:**
*   `/purge on`
*   `/purge off`

**Functionality:**
*   `/purge on`: Executes the server command `gamerule keepInventory false`. This means players will drop their inventory upon death, very scary.
*   `/purge off`: Executes the server command `gamerule keepInventory true`. This means players will keep their inventory upon death, not scary.

---

**Note:** This mod sends commands to the server. Ensure you have the necessary permissions on the server to execute the underlying commands (e.g., CoreProtect commands, prefix management commands, gamerule changes).
